# openwrt_packages
Some OpenWrt package Makefiles I made with help from #openwrt-devel

1. [duo_unix](https://github.com/Strykar/openwrt_packages/tree/master/duo_unix) - Duo Unix is a stand alone executable that can be used to protect programs such as OpenSSH or Sudo. I don't use _openssh-server-pam_ and _login_duo_ is	built without PAM support. See - https://duo.com/docs/loginduo

2. [mosh](https://github.com/Strykar/openwrt_packages/tree/master/mosh) - Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links. See - https://mosh.org
